HEllo team :)

this is a very simple java application we are going to work in collaboration.

Details of the project : 

 ***Typing master***

1. a desktop application will be created in which there will be levels to decide between 
	a.) Easy
	b.) Medium
	c.) Hard

2. According to the levels the speed of character bubbles will be manipulated.

3. Bubbles will go upward which contains the characters to be typed by the user.

4. And the application must count the number of hits and mishits as well with the time taken by the user.

5. And that's all.
